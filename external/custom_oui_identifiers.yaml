# Custom OUI Identifiers
# 
# This file allows you to define custom OUI-to-vendor mappings for WiFi devices.
# These will supplement or override the standard IEEE OUI database.
#
# Format:
#   oui_identifiers:
#     - oui: "XX:XX:XX"      # First 3 bytes of MAC address in uppercase
#       vendor_name: "Vendor Name"
#
# Examples:
# - Private/Local OUIs (starting with x2, x6, xA, xE in first octet)
# - Custom device naming for your network
# - Organization-specific device identification
# - Override standard vendor names with more specific descriptions

oui_identifiers:
  # Example: Private/Local OUIs - these are locally administered addresses
  - oui: "02:00:00"
    vendor_name: "Local Admin (Private)"
  - oui: "06:00:00"
    vendor_name: "Local Admin (Private)"
  - oui: "0A:00:00"
    vendor_name: "Local Admin (Private)"
  - oui: "0E:00:00"
    vendor_name: "Local Admin (Private)"

  # Example: Custom organizational devices
  - oui: "AA:BB:CC"
    vendor_name: "Custom Organization Device"
  - oui: "DD:EE:FF"
    vendor_name: "Test Lab Equipment"

  # Example: Override standard vendor with more specific info
  # (Uncomment and modify as needed)
  # - oui: "00:05:02"
  #   vendor_name: "Apple MacBook Pro"
  # - oui: "00:0C:29"
  #   vendor_name: "VMware Workstation VM"

  # Example: Common locally administered prefixes used by virtualization
  - oui: "52:54:00"
    vendor_name: "QEMU/KVM Virtual NIC"
  - oui: "08:00:27"
    vendor_name: "VirtualBox Virtual NIC"
    
  # Example: Docker and container networking
  - oui: "02:42:00"
    vendor_name: "Docker Container"
  - oui: "02:42:01"
    vendor_name: "Docker Container"
  - oui: "02:42:AC"
    vendor_name: "Docker Bridge Network"

  # Example: Common test/development ranges
  - oui: "DE:AD:BE"
    vendor_name: "Test Device"
  - oui: "CA:FE:BA"
    vendor_name: "Development Device"

# Notes:
# 1. OUIs must be in XX:XX:XX format with uppercase hex digits
# 2. This file is loaded after the main OUI database, so it can override entries
# 3. Custom entries take precedence over standard IEEE OUI entries
# 4. Private/local OUIs (bit 1 of first octet = 1) are not assigned by IEEE
# 5. Use 'python main.py update-oui-db' to reload after making changes
